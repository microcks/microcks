|[Michelin](https://www.michelin.fr/) | [Alex Picarle](https://github.com/AlexP63) | `End-User` | We use Microcks to elaborate our PoCs, to offer api sandbox or discovery trials and overall promote #DesignFirst approach.|
|[Amway](https://www.amway.com/) | [Brian Hibma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhibma/) [Sai Bommakanti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saiabhinay-bommakanti-31014943/) | `end user` | We use Microcks primarily as a platform for API and Event mocking and discovery, integrating it into our DevOps and CI/CD practices, and unblocking parallel, contract-based development from teams. |
|[BITMARCK](https://www.bitmarck.de) | [Michael Goll](https://github.com/goll-michael) | `end user` | We use Microcks to mock the APIs that correspond to the generated or manually created OpenAPI contracts.|
|[Agile Actors](https://www.agileactors.com/) | [Stelios Gkiokas](https://github.com/sgkiokas) | `Consultancy` | Microcks is used for speeding up the development time of multiple microservices, both locally and on CI, by leveraging the ability of auto-generating (dynamic) mocks via OpenAPI specs, gRPC contracts and GraphQL schemas in our case. We managed to bridge the gap we had in our client between developers, SETs and Manual QAs in the best possible manner.|
| [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914/) | `Another project` | AsyncAPI Generator is a tool that, among other things, is responsible for providing functionality to generate clients/SDKs. Thanks to Microcks, we were able to provide acceptance testing infrastructure that allows us to test, on a pull request level, if generated clients actually work. Microcks provides mocks, and we communicate with them through generated clients. Some more details you can find [in this directory in the generator repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/tree/master/packages/templates/clients/websocket/test), but this location is a subject for change as we want to start using Microcks not only for Websocket but now also for Kafka. |
