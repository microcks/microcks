## Principles
The Microcks project community adheres to the following principles:

- **Open**: The Microcks community strives to be open, accessible and welcoming to everyone. Anyone may contribute, and contributions are available to all users according to open source values and licenses.
- **Transparent** and **accessible**: Any changes to the Microcks source code and collaborations on the project are publicly accessible (GitHub code, issues, PRs, and discussions).
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Code of Conduct
Microcks follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is aligned with the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Conflict Resolutions
Typically, it is assumed that disputes will be resolved amicably by those involved. However, if the situation becomes more serious, conflicts will be resolved through a voting process. A supermajority of votes from project maintainers is required to make a decision, and the project lead has the final say in the ruling.

## Meetings
[Microcks](https://microcks.io/) hosts two monthly community meetings tailored for different time zones:

- **APAC-friendly Meeting:** Second Thursday of each month  
  - Time: 9â€“10 a.m. CET / 1â€“2 p.m. Bengaluru
- **America-friendly Meeting:** Fourth Thursday of each month  
  - Time: 6â€“7 p.m. CET / 1â€“2 p.m. EST / 9â€“10 a.m. PST

Hereâ€™s how to join and participate: https://github.com/microcks/community/blob/main/JOIN-OUR-MEETINGS.md

The maintainers will also have closed meetings to discuss security reports or Code of Conduct violations. Any maintainer in charge should schedule such meetings upon receiving a security issue or CoC report. All current Maintainers must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any maintainer accused of a CoC violation.

## Changes
This Project Governance is a living document. All key project changes, including changes in project governance, can be proposed by a GitHub PR and then reviewed and voted on by project maintainers.

As the Microcks community and project **grow**, we are **committed** to _progressing_ by _describing_ and _sharing_ our **governance model** along the way, **the open way**.
