        An AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a

        We recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to
        display an embedded component

        to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they
        expire relatively

        quickly, and cannot be used more than once.

            The client secret can be used to provide access to `account` from

      description: >-
        Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely
        persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.


        The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't
        view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to
        provide further permission control.


        All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets.
        Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a
        third-party API key.


        A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific
        Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user

            For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`,
            `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that
            hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe
            can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be
            `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know
            (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always
            run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank
            account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for
            any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be
            `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails,
            we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send
            [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule)
            until the bank details are updated.


            For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and
            `verification_failed`. If a payout fails, the status is set to
            `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details
            are updated. In the US and India, if we can't [verify the owner of
            the bank
            account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification),
            we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations
            aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for
            payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply.

        The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and

        billing management.


        A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you

        want to provide to your customers through the portal.


        A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for

        a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer

        can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security
        reasons,

        sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit
        the URL.

        Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their
        subscriptions

        and billing details.

        money to a different Stripe account through Connect also creates
        Charges.

        or [Payment Links](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-links). We

        new Session each time your customer attempts to pay.


        Once payment is successful, the Checkout Session will contain a

        to the [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers), and either the
        successful

        [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) or an
        active

        [Subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).


        You can create a Checkout Session on your server and redirect to its URL

        to begin Checkout.

        ConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe
        JS over

        to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the
        confirmation

        is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto
        the Intent.

            values that controls which saved payment methods the Payment Element
            displays by filtering to only show payment methods with an
            `allow_redisplay` value that is present in this list.

            subscriptions that depend on that payment method. Removing the

    event:
      description: >-
        Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting
        happens in

        your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`

        object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a
        `charge.succeeded`

        event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an

        `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create
        multiple

        events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a

        customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a

        `charge.succeeded` event.


        Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's
        data

        field embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For

        example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an

        `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.


        As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an

        [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a
        [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)

        from the API. We also have a separate

        [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the

        `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage

        webhooks in your

        [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn
        how

        to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)

        so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.


        When using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also
        receive event notifications

        that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there's an

        additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.


        We only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event
        API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event)

        for 30 days.

        `ExchangeRate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is
        currently

        using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is
        variable

        throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know
        the current

        rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a
        default

        payment in a foreign currency).


        Please refer to our [Exchange Rates
        API](https://stripe.com/docs/fx-rates) guide for more details.


        *[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]*
        Additionally,

        you can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you
        expect is

        current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges
        endpoints. If the

        value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer
        to our

        [Using with charges](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for
        more details.

        requests with your credentials

        provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the
        payment_method into the request.


        Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including
        authentication credentials and card numbers,

        before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request
        object, which are subject to a

        30-day retention period.


        You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with
        the same key result in only one

        outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique
        and different from any idempotency

        keys provided on the underlying third-party request.


        Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or
        time out according to

        Stripe’s limits.

        A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify
        data from a user.

        The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the
        `type` and `options`

        parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check
        performed in the

        appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.


        Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the
        user as well as

        reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the
        [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)

        API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the

        [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions)
        API.

        of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such
        as what [verification

        check](/docs/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one
        VerificationSession for

        each verification in your system.


        A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple

        it progresses through

        the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the user's
        verified data after

        verification checks are complete.

    invoice:
      description: >-
        Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either

        generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.


        They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems),
        and proration adjustments

        that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).


        If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,

        Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note

        that finalizing the invoice,

        [when
        automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection),
        does

        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits

        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last

        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have

        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after

        creation to finalize the invoice.


        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then
        based on your

        [email
        settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),

        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These

        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.


        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the

        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually

        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's
        [minimum allowed charge

        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the

        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the

        customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.


        More details on the customer's credit balance are

        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

        Invoice Items represent the component lines of an
        [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices). An invoice item is
        added to an

        invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which
        point it will be included as

        [an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item)
        within

        [invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).


        Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the
        invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined

        with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).
        Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually
        charge

        or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing
        cycle. This is useful for combining several charges

        (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your
        usage-based billing totals.

        A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment
        from your customer.

        We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or

        customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent
        later to

        see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.


        A PaymentIntent transitions through

        [multiple
        statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)

        throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform

        authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful
        charge.

            method](/payments/save-during-payment) to the Customer after the

            If the payment method is `card_present` and isn't a digital wallet,

        PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed
        to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method
        types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of
        payment methods for different scenarios.


        There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used
        depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):


        **Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account,
        including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and
        transfers, and payments not involving Connect.


        **Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected
        accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of
        parameter.


        Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and
        controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify
        a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the
        connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent
        configurations are [managed in the
        dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts)
        and are not available in this API.

        You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices
        API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and
        is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.


        Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring
        purchases of products.

        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track
        inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different
        physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products,
        and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets
        you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.


        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for
        $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

        Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for
        both recurring and one-time purchases of products.

        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track
        inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms.
        Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by
        products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This
        approach lets you change prices without having to change your
        provisioning scheme.


        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for
        $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

    setup_intent:
      description: >-
        A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a
        customer's payment credentials for future payments.

        For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your
        customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.

        Later, you can use
        [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive
        the payment flow.


        Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's
        payment credentials.

        Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might
        not be valid.

        The SetupIntent transitions through multiple
        [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as
        it guides

        you through the setup process.


        Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized
        for future payments.

        For example, cardholders in [certain
        regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might
        need to be run through

        [Strong Customer
        Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)
        during payment method collection

        to streamline later [off-session
        payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).

        If you use the SetupIntent with a
        [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),

        it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer
        after successful setup.

        We recommend using SetupIntents or
        [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage)
        on

        PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or
        unoptimized payment methods.


        By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even
        as regulations change over time.

        `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They

        represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the
        Stripe API

        just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can
        be

        attached to customers.


        Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources
        API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).

        We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods
        API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).

        This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method
        types.

            Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`,
            `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, or `paused`. 


            For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves
            into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A
            subscription in this status can only have metadata and
            default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the
            subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is
            not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to
            `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice
            will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 


            A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and
            moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 


            A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends
            without a payment
            method](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment).
            A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed
            after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status
            is different from [pausing
            collection](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment),
            which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status
            unchanged. 


            If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes
            `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to
            failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has
            exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become
            `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 


            If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes
            `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and
            `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional
            deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of
            `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be
            created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving
            updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to
            reopen and pay their closed invoices.

    token:
      description: >-
        Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or
        bank

        account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly
        from

        your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information
        is

        returned to your server to use. Use our

        [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to
        perform this process

        on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches
        your server,

        and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.


        If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens
        using

        the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If

        your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI
        compliance

        that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe.
        Unlike with

        client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent
        directly to

        Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.


        You can't store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank
        account

        information for later use, create
        [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)

        objects or [External accounts](/api#external_accounts).

        [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for
        automatic fraud protection,

        performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

        <li>Refunds: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or
        link existing refunds (using <code>refunds</code>).</li>

        <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their
        next invoice when it’s finalized.</li>

                    Only applies to subscriptions with
                    `collection_method=charge_automatically`.


                    Use `allow_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with
                    `status=incomplete` if the first invoice can't be paid.
                    Creating Subscriptions with this status allows you to manage
                    scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to
                    pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation
                    may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the
                    [SCA Migration
                    Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
                    for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


                    Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with
                    `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment,
                    otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to
                    `status=active` when successfully confirming the
                    PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler
                    management of scenarios where additional customer actions
                    are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed
                    payments, [SCA
                    regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
                    or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If
                    the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours
                    Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`,
                    which is a terminal state.


                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an
                    HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice can't
                    be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS
                    authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer
                    action is needed, this parameter doesn't create a
                    Subscription and returns an error instead. This was the
                    default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See
                    the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14)
                    to learn more.


                    `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot
                    be passed when creating a Subscription.


                    Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are
                    automatically activated regardless of the first Invoice

        point it will be canceled and not renewed. Otherwise, with the default
        <code>false</code> value, the subscription is terminated immediately. In
        either case, the customer will not be charged again for the
        subscription.</p>


        <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created
        will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a

        to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations will also be

        subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be

        <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop
        automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is
        intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has
        canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of
        the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us
        proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the

                payment_behavior:
                  description: >-
                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
                    `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be
                    paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional
                    user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For
                    example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to
                    complete payment. See the [SCA Migration
                    Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
                    for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
                    `status=past_due` when payment is required and await
                    explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This
                    allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user
                    actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as
                    failed payments, [SCA
                    regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
                    or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.


                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using
                    [pending
                    updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates).
                    When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the
                    parameters [supported by pending
                    updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).


                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an
                    HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be
                    paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS
                    authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action
                    is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription
                    and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior
                    for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the
                    [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to

                    endpoint. `proration_date` can also be used to implement
                    custom proration logic, such as prorating by day instead of
                    by second, by providing the time that you wish to use for
                    proration calculations.

        prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>

      summary: Create an invoice
  /v1/invoices/create_preview:
    post:
      description: >-
        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a subscription
        or subscription schedule. This will show you all the charges that are
        pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges,
        etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the
        invoice.</p>


        <p>You can also preview the effects of creating or updating a
        subscription or subscription schedule, including a preview of any
        prorations that will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is
        calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass
        the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> parameter when
        doing the actual subscription update.</p>


        <p>The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed on the
        invoice is to consider line items where
        <code>parent.subscription_item_details.proration</code> is
        <code>true</code>.</p>


        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply
        viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the
        upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you
        cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the
        amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update
        pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>


        <p>Note: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates.
        Exchange rates may vary between the time of the preview and the time of
        the actual invoice creation. <a
